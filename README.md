# AquisAssignment
Repository for the handson test by AquisExchange


Entrypoint file is `main.py`. I created a couple of ausiliary modules to better split all the functions I have been using. 
This improve a bit readability and understanding of this simple code base.
The file `src/utils.py` containes the fucntions used to parse the data from the text file, 
while `src/data_process.py` contains the function that have been used to manipulate the DataFrames.

The jupyter notebook `exploration.ipynb` contains a draft version of all the functions and many tests performed 
in order to parse correctly the data and to properly manipulated the DataFrames.
