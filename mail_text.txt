Hi Matteo. Thanks for taking the time to speak with me. As discussed, here is the assignment:

In Python3, read the public data for exchange events that occur on Aquis Exchange UK:

[*** Url Redacted ***]

and

Produce a TSV (tab separated value) Order Add aggregate report with headers in this format:

ISIN | Currency | Total Buy Count | Total Sell Count | Total Buy Quantity | Total Sell Quantity | Weighted Average Buy Price | Weighted Average Sell Price | Max Buy Price | Min Sell Price

Security reference data records are identified where msgType_ = 8.
Order Add records are identified where msgType_ = 12

Be creative, and focus on how you would demonstrate your level of production-level quality: performance, robustness, and code style. What you produce will be used to drive the next stage of the interview.

If you have any questions or observations, let me know!

Regards.
Viet
